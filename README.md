# Boring stuff
I obviously do not own anything related to Shadowrun, and have included no directly quoted rules text in this tool bar the names of the actions.

# Technical stuff
This was made with React, in TypeScript.

# Action console for Shadowrun Sixth World

Ever had trouble keeping track of actions in a tabletop RPG? My players sure have, so I made this little tool for them. It keeps track of the actions you've taken over the round, so you don't have to worry beyond keeping track of your Initiative Dice.

Live online version, for people who don't want to touch the code: https://pontusandersson.tech/sr6-action-console/

# Instructions
Run frontend (not that this has a backend ... yet!) with:

### yarn install

... to install the packages. Then:

### yarn start

... to run development server locally.

Happy shadowrunning!
