# Boring stuff
I obviously do not own anything related to Shadowrun, and have included no directly quoted rules text in this tool bar the names of the actions.

# Technical stuff
This was made with React, in TypeScript.

# Action console for Shadowrun Sixth World

Ever had trouble keeping track of actions in a tabletop RPG? My players sure have, so I made this little tool for them. It keeps track of the actions you've taken over the round, so you don't have to worry beyond keeping track of your Initiative Dice.


# Instructions
Run frontend (not that this has a backend ... yet!) with:

### yarn install

... to install the packages. Then:

### yarn start

... to run development server locally.

Or use the online version: https://pontusandersson.tech/sr6-action-console/

Happy shadowrunning!
